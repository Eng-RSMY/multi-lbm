We implemented a lattice Boltzmann method for immiscible multiphase flow simulations combined with the level set method according to the paper of G. Th&ouml;mmes et al. [1]. The level set method is used to compute the movement of the interface between the phases. The input for the level set method is computed by the lattice Boltzmann method. We verified our implementation with different test cases.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
In engineering the immiscible multiphase flow problem often needs to be considered. For example, bubble dynamics are decisive for the design of chemical reactors. Also, fingering in oil recovery is a common multiphase problem.
</p>
<p>
We restricted ourselves to two fluid phases, but the method is trivially extensible for multiple phases. There are different approaches to solve the immiscible two-phase problem. The most spread among these is the colour gradient method of Gunstensen and Rothman. The downside of this method is that it is only applicable for small density and viscosity differences. Another approach is the concept of interaction potentials by Shan and Chen which actually models miscible fluids and can only approximately describe the behavior of immiscible fluids. Furthermore, there are free surface methods which only take one fluid into account for computation [2]. They work best for large viscosity and density ratios.
</p>
<p>
In our project we used a coupled lattice Boltzmann level set method. The motion of the interface is modeled by the level set method. The input data for the level set method is given by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is applied independently for each fluid phase. This method has the advantage that it allows large ranges of viscosity- and density-ratios between the fluid phases, while describing a sharp interface.

<h3>Methods</h3>
<h4>Macroscopic laws</h4>
<p>
The incompressible two-phase flow problem can be described mathematically with the Navier-Stokes equations for two incompressible fluids (eqs. (1.1) and (1.2), see [3]). To apply them, we distribute our domain into three parts: &Omega;<sub>1</sub> and &Omega;<sub>2</sub> describe the two fluids and &Gamma; is the interface in-between (Fig. 1). The material properties in each fluid are constant and the interface is assumed to be sharp. Thus, the overall material properties are discontinuous and the fluids will not mix.

Here, u<sub>i</sub> is the velocity, p<sub>i</sub> the pressure, &nu;<sub>i</sub> the kinematic viscosity and &rho;<sub>i</sub> the mass density.
As boundary conditions and initial conditions we use,

<p>
At the interface &Gamma; we have a no-slip condition, i.e. continuity of the velocities between the fluid phases and the balance of viscous shear stress with surface tension. Therefore, we get the jump conditions,

<h4>Numerical methods</h4>
<p>
The Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a lattice Boltzmann method. A detailed introduction into the LBM by Succi can be found in [4]. The position of the phase interface is tracked with a level set method, see e.g. [5] for a general introduction.
</p>

<p>
To ensure the macroscopic jump condition at the phase interface an additional boundary condition is introduced in the lattice Boltzmann method in neighbour-cells to the interface. In simplified terms this condition is a bounce-back condition that ensures the continuity of velocities, as well as the balance of shear stress w.r.t. to the interface position between the LBM cells. <br/>
Moreover, a refill method is required to estimate the unknown PDFs of the LBM cells that changed their type from one fluid phase to the other, due to movement of the interface. Here a weighted interpolation from three interior neighbour cells is used.
