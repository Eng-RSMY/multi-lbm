We implemented the lattice Boltzmann method for immiscible multiphase flow simulations and combined it with the level set method according to the paper of G. Th&ouml;mmes et al. [1]. The level set method is used to compute the movement of the interface between the two phases. The input for the level set method is computed by the lattice Boltzmann method. We verified our implementation with different test cases.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
In engineering the immiscible multiphase flow problem often needs to be considered. For example, bubble dynamics are decisive for the design of chemical reactors [5]. Also, fingering in oil recovery is a common multiphase problem.

<p>
In the following we will restrict ourselves to two fluid phases, but the procedure is also applicable for multiple phases. There are different approaches to solve the immiscible two- phase problem. The most spread among these is the colour gradient method of Gunstensen and Rothman [6, 7, 8]. The downside of this method is that it is only applicable for small density and viscosity differences. Another approach is the concept of interaction potentials by Shan and Chen [9, 10]. This method actually models miscible fluids and can only approximately describe the behavior of immiscible fluids. Furthermore, there are free surface methods which only take one fluid into account for computation [11, 12, 13]. They work best for large viscosity and density ratios.
</p>
<p>
In this publication we use a hybrid lattice Boltzmann level set method. The motion of the interface is modeled by the level set method. The input data for the level set method is given by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is applied independently for each fluid. This method has the advantage that it allows large ranges of viscosity- and density-ratios between the fluid phases, while describing a sharp interface.
