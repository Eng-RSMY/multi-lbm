We implemented a lattice Boltzmann method for immiscible multiphase flow simulations combined with the level set method according to the paper of G. Th&ouml;mmes et al. [1]. The level set method is used to compute the movement of the interface between the phases. The input for the level set method is computed by the lattice Boltzmann method. We verified our implementation with different test cases.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
In engineering the immiscible multiphase flow problem often needs to be considered. For example, bubble dynamics are decisive for the design of chemical reactors. Also, fingering in oil recovery is a common multiphase problem.
</p>
<p>
We restricted ourselves to two fluid phases, but the method is trivially extensible for multiple phases. There are different approaches to solve the immiscible two-phase problem. The most spread among these is the colour gradient method of Gunstensen and Rothman. The downside of this method is that it is only applicable for small density and viscosity differences. Another approach is the concept of interaction potentials by Shan and Chen which actually models miscible fluids and can only approximately describe the behavior of immiscible fluids. Furthermore, there are free surface methods which only take one fluid into account for computation [2]. They work best for large viscosity and density ratios.
</p>
<p>
In our project we used a coupled lattice Boltzmann level set method. The motion of the interface is modeled by the level set method. The input data for the level set method is given by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is applied independently for each fluid phase. This method has the advantage that it allows large ranges of viscosity- and density-ratios between the fluid phases, while describing a sharp interface.

<h3>Development overview</h3>
<p>
The incompressible two-phase flow problem can be described mathematically with the Navier-Stokes equations for two incompressible fluids (eqs. (1.1) and (1.2), see [3]). To apply them, we distribute our domain into three parts: &Omega;<sub>1</sub> and &Omega;<sub>2</sub> describe the two fluids and &Gamma; is the interface in-between (Fig. 1). The material properties in each fluid are constant and the interface is assumed to be sharp. Thus, the overall material properties are discontinuous and the fluids will not mix.

Here, u<sub>i</sub> is the velocity, p<sub>i</sub> the pressure, &nu;<sub>i</sub> the kinematic viscosity and &rho;<sub>i</sub> the mass density.

At the interface &Gamma; we have a no-slip condition, i.e. continuity of the velocities between the fluid phases and the balance of viscous shear stress with surface tension. Therefore, we get the jump conditions,
