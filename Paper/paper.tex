\begin{abstract}
	We implemented the lattice Boltzmann method for immiscible multiphase flow simulations and combined it with the level set method according to the paper of G. Th\"ommes \cite{Thoemmes}. The level set method is used to calculate the movement of the interface between the two phases. The input for the level set method is computed by the lattice Boltzmann method. We reimplemented the test cases that are mentioned in the paper, to study the method-coupling and its impact on accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
%Something about the two-phase problem and some other algorithms that solve it. We could do this according to the presentation-slides.
In engineering the immiscible two-phase flow problem often needs to be considered. For example, bubble dynamics are decisive for the design of chemical reactors. Also fingering in oil recovery is a common two-phase problem.

The two-phase flow problem can be described with the Navier-Stokes equations for two incompressible fluids. To apply them, we distribute our domain into three parts: $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ describe the two fluids and $\Gamma = \delta\Omega_1 \cap \delta\Omega_2$ is the interface (Fig. \ref{intro_phases}). The material properties in each fluid are constant and the interface is assumed to be sharp. Thus the material properties are discontinuous and the fluids won't mix.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\flushright
	\includegraphics[width=11cm,natwidth=1690,natheight=1174]{skizze.png}
	\caption{Two fluid domains $\Omega_i$ and the interface $\Gamma$ in between}
	\label{intro_phases}
\end{figure}

The evolution of the flow fields within each fluid can be expressed with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations:
\begin{equation}
	\nabla \cdot  \vec u_i = 0 \text{  in } \Omega_i \text{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \vec u_i}{\partial t} + \left(\vec  u_i\cdot \nabla \right) \vec u_i
=
-\frac{1}{\varrho_i}\nabla p_i + \nu_i \nabla^2 \vec u_i \text{  in } \Omega_i \text{.}
\end{equation}
Here, $u_i$ is the velocity, $p_i$ the pressure, $v_i$ the kinematic viscosity and $\varrho_i$ the mass density.

Furthermore, we need boundary conditions and initial conditions. For our domain-boundaries and the interior we can take for example
\begin{equation}
	u_i(x,t) = 0 \text{, on } \delta\Omega_i \backslash \Gamma \text{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	u_i(x,0) = u_{ini,i}(x) \text{, in } \Omega_i \text{.}
\end{equation}
For the interface $\Gamma$ we have the influence of the surface tension and we assume continuity of the velocities within the fluids. Therefore, we get the following jump conditions:
\begin{equation}
	[u] = 0 \text{,  } [T]n = 2 \sigma \kappa n \text{.}
	\label{jumpconditions}
\end{equation}
Here, T is the stress tensor, $\sigma$ the surface tension, and $\kappa$ the curvature of the interface with respect to its normal $n$. Brackets denote the jump of a quantity at the interface: 
$[q](x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} (q(x - \epsilon n) - (q(x + \epsilon n)) \text{ with } x \in \Gamma$ % I also turned this around, according to [p].
. In Fig. \ref{intro_phases} this would be the jump from $\Omega_1$ to $\Omega_2$. For the other direction the sign changes.

There are different approaches to solve the immiscible two-phase problem. The most spread among these approaches is the colour gradient method of Gunstensen and Rothman \cite{GRcg1,GRcg2,GRcg3}. The downside of this method is that it is only applicable for small density and viscosity differences. Another approach is the concept of {\it interaction potentials} by Shan and Chen \cite{ShanChen1,ShanChen2}. This method actually models miscible fluids and can only approximately describe the behavior of immiscible fluids. Furthermore there are free surface methods which only take one fluid in account for computation (\cite{Koerner}). They work best for big density and viscosity differences.

The method we are presenting uses a hybrid lattice Boltzmann level set method. Thereby the surface motion is calculated by the level set method. The input data for the level set method is given by the lattice Boltzmann method, which is calculated independently for each fluid. This method has the advantage that it has a high accuracy but requires only little memory.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an introduction to the numerical methods and the coupling of these. In section 3 we present our results and finally in section 4 we draw a conclusion.

\section{Numerical Methods}
The algorithm uses two numerical methods. Before we show how these can be coupled, we will shortly introduce the numerical methods independently.

\subsection{The Lattice Boltzmann Method}
To solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we use the lattice Boltzmann method. This method describes the evolution of the particle density $f(\vec{x},\vec{v},t)$ in phase space, with $(\vec{x},\vec{v})$ as the phase space variables and $t$ as time. The LBM algorithm discretizes with a regular grid in space and with restricted number of velocities adapted to this grid \cite{LBM1,LBM2,LBM3,LBM4}. We use the D2Q9 model in 2D, which has 9 velocity vectors on a plane grid with unit spacing including one zero velocity (Fig. \ref{lbmc_i}). 
\begin{figure}
	\hfill\includegraphics[width=6cm,natwidth=403,natheight=409]{LBMc_i.png}\hspace*{\fill}
	\caption{The vectors of one cell in LBM}
	\label{lbmc_i}
\end{figure}
The vectors are given by the columns of the matrix
\begin{equation}
	c = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 1 & 1 &  1 &  0 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
	0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & -1 &  0 &  1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\text{.}
\end{equation}
The corresponding particle distributions are denoted by $f_i(\vec{x},t) = f(\vec{x},\vec{c_i},t)$. We get the density and velocity from the particle distribution functions with:
\begin{equation}
	\rho(\vec{x},t) = \sum_{i=0}^{8} f_i(\vec{x},t) \text{, } 
	\vec{u} = \sum_{i=0}^{8} f_i(\vec{x},t)\vec{c_i} \text{.}
\end{equation}
For the collision step we use the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) approximation \cite{BGK}
\begin{equation}
	f_i(\vec{x}+\vec{c_i},t+1) = f_i(\vec{x},t) - \frac1\tau(f_i-f_i^{eq}) + G_i \text{.}
\end{equation}
The parameter $\tau$ is the relaxation parameter for the BGK collision operator and controls the kinematic viscosity $\nu = \frac16(2\tau - 1)$. $G_i$ is an additional force like gravity or a magnetic field. In our case we set $G_i = 0$. Furthermore, we use the equilibrium distribution
\begin{equation}
	f_i^{eq}(\rho,\vec{u}) = f_i^*(\rho + 3\vec{c_i} \cdot \vec{u} + \frac92(\vec{c_i} \cdot \vec{u})^2 - \frac32{|\vec{u}|}^2)
\end{equation}
with the corresponding D2Q9 weight factors
$$
f_i^* = \begin{cases} \frac49 \text{,} & i = 0 \\ \frac19 \text{,} & i = 1,3,5,7 \\ \frac{1}{36} \text{,} &  i = 2,4,6,8 \end{cases} \text{.}
$$

One time step in the LBM algorithm is achieved by the following sub-steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1. ] Collision step: $f_i^+ = f_i - \frac1\tau(f_i - f_i ^{eq}) + G_i$
	\item[2. ] Propagation step: $f_i(\vec{x}+\vec{c_i},t+1) = f_i^+(x,t)$, for interior nodes
	\item[3. ] Boundary conditions: $f_i(\vec{x}+\vec{c_i},t+1) = f_i(\vec{x}+\vec{c_i},t)$, if $\vec{x} \notin \Omega$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Level Set Method}
We deal with the movement of the interface between the two fluids by using the level set method. The method captures the surface that represents the interface with a continuous signed distance function which has the interface as the zero level set.

Let $\Gamma_t$ be our interface at time t. Within the level set method, $\Gamma_t$ is the zero iso-surface of the level set function $\varphi$. Thus for $x \in \Gamma_t$ we have $\varphi(x,t) = 0$, in direction of the surface normal we get $\varphi > 0$, and in the other direction we get $\varphi < 0$. For this level set function we get the level set equation of Osher and Sethian \cite{OsherSethian} for the evolution of free surfaces
\begin{equation}
	\varphi_t + v \cdot \nabla \varphi = 0 \text{,}
\end{equation}
with the velocity $v = v(x(t)) = \dot x(t)$ for $x(t) \in \Gamma_t$.

To solve this equation we use the Toolbox of Ian Mitchell \cite{mitchell} for Matlab. This toolbox takes as input the velocity field we get from the lattice Boltzmann method and computes the movement of the interface. The toolbox also provides functions to calculate the normal and the curvature of the surface. We will need this informations for the coupling of the methods.

\subsection{Coupling of LBM and level set method}
The lattice Boltzmann method requires a boundary treatment at the interface which implements the jump conditions (\ref{jumpconditions}). For sake of simplicity, we don't write arrows for every vector, i.e. $\vec{u} \rightarrow u$. One should consider that every position, direction, and velocity is two-dimensional. 

For the coupling, we create a new boundary condition that is based on a simple bounce back type Dirichlet condition. For example, in Fig. \ref{coupling} for a point $x_2 \in \Omega_2$ that is next to the boundary we set
\begin{figure}
	\hfill\includegraphics[width=10cm,natwidth=437,natheight=178]{coupling.png}\hspace*{\fill}
	\caption{link between two points in different fluids}
	\label{coupling}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
	f_i(x_2,t+1) = f_{i*}^+(x_2,t) + 6hf_i^*c_i \cdot \tilde{u} + R_i \text{.}
\end{equation}
Here, $\tilde{u}$ describes the linear interpolation of the velocity along the direction $c_i$, evaluated at the location $\tilde{x} = x_1 + qc_i = x_2 + (q-1)c_i$ on the interface,
$$
\tilde{u} = qu(x_2,t) + (1-q)u(x_1,t) \text{.}
$$
The additional term $R_i$ ensures the jump conditions of the normal stress and corrects the error terms that are caused by the bounce back treatment. $R_i$ is given as:
\begin{equation}
	R_i = 6 h^2 f_i^* \Lambda_i : A \text{ with } A = -q(1-q)[S] - (q - \frac12)S^{(2)} \text{.}
\end{equation}
We can rewrite $R_i$ in the form
\begin{equation}
	R_i = 6h^2f_i^* \cdot (-q(1-q)\Lambda_i:[S] - (q-\frac12)\Lambda_i:S_2 \text{,}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_i = c_i \otimes c_i - \frac13 {|c_i|}^2 \mathbf{I} \text{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	S_k = -\frac{3}{2\tau h^2} \sum_i c_i \otimes c_i(f_i-f_i^{eq})(t,x_k) \text{.}
\end{equation}
The tensor product is $a \otimes b = ab^T$ and the double contraction $A:B = \mathrm{trace}(AB^T)$. Furthermore, we have
\begin{equation}
	\Lambda_i:[S] = ([S]:n \otimes n)((n \cdot c_i)^2 - {|c_i|}^2/3) + 2([S]:n \otimes t_k)(n \cdot c_i)(t_k \cdot c_i) \text{,}
\end{equation}
with the terms
\begin{equation}
	[S]:n \otimes n =  \frac{1}{2 \bar\mu} ([p] + 2 \sigma \kappa) - \frac{[\mu]}{\bar{\mu}} \bar{S} : n \otimes n \text{,}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	[S]:n \otimes t_k = - \frac{[\mu]}{\bar{\mu}} \bar{S} : n \otimes t_k \text{.}
\end{equation}
Here $n$ is the normal of the interface, $t$ the tangential, $\bar{S} = (S_1 + S_2)/2$ the averaged symmetric velocity gradient, $\kappa$ the curvature, and $\mu$ the dynamic viscosity, with $[\mu] = \mu_2 - \mu_1$ as its jump.
The pressure jump is formulated by
\begin{equation}
	[p] \approx \frac{1}{3 h^2} (\rho(x_2,t)\varrho_2 - \rho(x_1,t)\varrho_1) \text{.}
\end{equation}
What is still missing, is a refill method. Due to the fact that the interface moves, some cells change their fluid type. We use an equilibrium/non-equilibrium refill as it is described in \cite{Caiazzo} that consists out of four steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] Interpolate density and velocity from interior neighbors
	\item[2] Compute the corresponding equilibrium
	\item[3] Copy the non-equilibrium part from a direct interior neighbor
	\item[4] Reinitialise by adding equilibrium and non-equilibrium parts
\end{itemize}
Suppose we choose an inward pointing direction $c_i$ in a boundary point $x \in \Omega_1$, e.g. the direction of biggest angle with the surface normal. Then the density is interpolated by
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\rho} = 3\rho(x+c_i,t+1) - 3\rho(x+2c_i,t+1) + \rho(x+3c_i,t+1) \text{.}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
	\hfill\includegraphics[width=8cm,natwidth=445,natheight=305]{refillmethod.png}\hspace*{\fill}
	\caption{Cells that are used for the refill method}
	\label{refill}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{refill} shows the cells we use for the interpolation. In \cite{Thoemmes} the velocity is interpolated by using the velocity of the interface. The Ian-Mitchell toolbox does not provide a function to access this value. Therefore, we follow the formula given in \cite{Lallemand} that is basically the same we use for density:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{u} = 3u(x+c_i,t+1) - 3u(x+2c_i,t+1) + u(x+3c_i,t+1) \text{.}
\end{equation}
We can now calculate the new equilibrium $f_i^{eq}(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ and add it to the non-equilibrium part that we copy from the direct neighbor:
$$f_i(\vec{x},t+1) = f_i^{eq}(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u}) + f_i^{neq}(x+c_i,t+1) \text{.}$$
We have to repeat the procedure for other fluid.
\begin{figure}
	\hfill\includegraphics[width=8cm,natwidth=632,natheight=562]{dataexchange.png}\hspace*{\fill}
	\caption{Data exchange between LBM and level set method}
	\label{dataexchange}
\end{figure}

Finally, we can couple the two methods in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] Create the initial interface $\Gamma_0$
	\item[2.] Run the level set code once to create the surface description for LBM
	\item[3.] Run the LBM using the data from the level set for a prescribed number of steps
	\item[4.] Pass the current velocity field to the level set code and run it for the same number of steps (see Fig. \ref{dataexchange})
	\item[5.] Repeat step 3 and 4 until the end of the simulation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results and Examples}
To verify the correctness of our implementation we firstly created a Couette flow and compared our results with the one we get from the analytic solution. Secondly, we used the same LBM setup but with a different fluid distribution to check the behavior of our implementation for more complex problems.

\subsection{Couette channel flow}
The Couette channel flow consists of a fixed lower wall at $y=0$ and an upper wall at $y=1$ that is moving with a constant velocity. At these walls we use no-slip boundary conditions. To create a channel flow, we use periodic boundary conditions for the boundaries at the inflow $x=0$ and the outflow $x=1$. The two fluids are distributed in a way that the interface is parallel to our walls.
%TODO: give information about the parameter
%TODO: show graph with results

For the Couette channel flow exists an analytic solution that can be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations
$$
v(x) = \begin{cases} v_0 (\frac{\mu_1}{\mu_1+\mu_2}x + \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1+\mu_2}) \text{,} & x \ge 0 \\ v_0 (\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1+\mu_2}x + \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1+\mu_2}) \text{,} & x < 0 \text{,}\end{cases}
$$
where $\mu_1$ denotes the dynamic viscosity in the lower fluid and $\mu_2$ the viscosity in upper fluid.

\subsection{Bubble tracing}
To verify the correctness of our implementation also for more complex problems, we changed the fluid distribution in our Couette channel flow such that one fluid is a bubble within the other fluid. We set all material parameters of the fluids to the same values. Thus one would expect that we get the same flow field as for only a single fluid and the interface merely serves as a tracer. FIGURE ?? shows how the bubble that is initialized as circle changes to an elliptic shape caused by the flow field within the channel.

%TODO: name the settings we used
%TODO: add some nice pictures
